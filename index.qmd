I have a number of ongoing projects relating to college football using data from collegefootballdata.com.

Disclaimer: Despite spending more years at Florida State (and being on campus for the 2013 championship season) while I worked on my PhD, my own college football loyalties lie with my undergraduate university, Texas A&M.
